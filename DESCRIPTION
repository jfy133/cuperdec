Description: Calculates and visualises cumulative percent 'decay' curves,
    which are typically calculated from metagenomic taxonomic profiles.
    These can be used to estimate the level of expected 'endogenous' taxa
    at different abundance levels retrieved from metagenomic samples, when
    comparing to samples of known sampling site or source.
