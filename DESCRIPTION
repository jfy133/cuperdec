Description: This library calculates and visualises cumulative percent 'decay' 
    curves, which are typically calculated from metagenomic taxonomic profiles. 
    These can be used to estimate the level of expected 'endogenous' taxa at 
    different abundance levels retrieved from metagenomic samples, when 
    comparing to samples of known sampling site or source.
